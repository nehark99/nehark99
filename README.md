<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I grew up in a family full of Software Engineers â€” and lo and behold, I ended up becoming one too. I've always been drawn to math, puzzles, and problem-solving. Combine that with my love for coding, and pursuing Computer Science for both my Bachelor's and Master's was a natural path.

Personally, Iâ€™d describe myself as someone who knows a little about a lot when it comes to Computer Science. I'm always striving to broaden and deepen that knowledge, one day at a time. So all in all, my goal is to keep building meaningful software that makes a difference â€” and to enjoy the process while I'm at it :) </p>
